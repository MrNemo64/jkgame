This is a university project I worked on during 2022-2023, which I liked enough to showcase.

It's a game where we learned about sockets, HTTP, and Kafka, as well as how to secure a connection and make it resilient. The project includes, for example, functionality that allows players to reconnect if they lose their connection.
